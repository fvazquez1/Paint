		-Line width, and line color affect the straight line
- Keyboard shortcuts introduced
	- Ctrl + S = Save
	- Ctrl + Shift + S = Save As

Known Issues:
-Save isn't overwriting the file in it's position, so "Save As..." must be used to save an image or drawing
-About pop-up isn't very appealing to the eye
-Need to click the "x" for the pop-up windows for both line color and line width in order for the selection to be saved
-Safe save does not work, so the something MUST be saved for the application to close properly
-Color Grabber does not work 
-Increasing line thickness seems to cause jagged edges when drawing. This may have been an issue already, but has not yet been noted.
-Undo button does not work

Expected Next Sprint: 
- Adding text to the image
- Adding more shapes
- Adding an eraser
- Adding a redo button
- Adding a way for the shape, or line, being drawn to be seen as it is being adjusted
