New Features:

-Menu Bar now has a "Help" and "Draw" option
	-"Help" has an about that opens these release notes
	-"Draw" has 3 options: (1)Draw Line, (2)Set Line Color, (3)Set Line Width
		-Draw Line works as a toggle, so it must be clicked when before you can draw. After this, just click and drag to draw
		-Set Line Color opens up a color chooser, and allows you to draw in your favorite color
		-Set Line Width opens up a slider to adjust the width of your line when you draw 
-Drawing on an image
	-You can now draw on an image after you open it!
	-Want to save your masterpiece? Just click "Save As..." once you're done drawing
-Scroll Bar added 
-"Save As..." automatically saves as a .png file
Known Issues:
-Save isn't overwriting the file in it's position, so "Save As..." must be used to save an image or drawing
-About pop-up isn't very appealing to the eye
-Need to click the "x" for the pop-up windows for both line color and line width in order for the selection to be saved

Expected Next Sprint: 
-Selecting and Drawing shapes on the canvas
-Getting the "Save" button to work 
-Beautify the "About" page
