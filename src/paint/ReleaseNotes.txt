Frankie's Paint Version 6.0 - 10/07/2020

New Features: 
- Threaded Auto-Save
	- If there is already a set file path for the current image/canvas being worked on, then it will be auto-saved every 25 seconds
	- This feature can be turned off by going to File > Toggle Auto Save
- Open Multiple Tabs!
	- Any number of tabs can be opened to be painted on! Each tab can also open it's own picture!
	- To create a new tab, just click on the blank tab next to the current tab being worked on!
- Logging
	- Also happening every 25 seconds, a log of what tool is being used AND what file is being worked on!
- Tool-Tips for Every Button on the Tool Bar!
	- Hover over any button on the tool bar for some extra help
- Dashed Lines!
	- Can now toggle if the line being drawn is dashed!

Worthy Notes (Due to the new tab feature):
- The safe save feature still works, but it will only prompt the user to save IF at least one image has not been saved.
	- This means that a tab can be opened, painted on, saved, then closed, and the safe save will NOT trigger.
- Scroll Bar Disappeared
	- For some reason, with the new layout the scroll pane has gone missing. 

Known Issues:
- Color Grabber does not work.
- Undo and Redo button do properly not work. 
	- The buttons do have an effect on the canvas.
- Shapes and Lines are not updated live.
- Weird error in unit test
